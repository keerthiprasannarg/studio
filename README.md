## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.0 or later recommended)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A Google account to create a Firebase project.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Firebase Project

This application requires a Firebase project to handle authentication and the database.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Click on **"Add project"** and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

2.  **Enable Authentication:**

    - In your new project's console, navigate to the **Build** section in the left sidebar.
    - Click on **Authentication**.
    - Click the **"Get started"** button.
    - Under the "Sign-in method" tab, select **Email/Password** from the list of providers and enable it.

3.  **Set Up Firestore Database:**

    - From the **Build** section, click on **Firestore Database**.
    - Click **"Create database"**.
    - A wizard will appear. Choose to start in **Test mode**. This will allow open read/write access during development.
      > **Warning:** Test mode is not secure for a production environment. For production, you must set up proper security rules.
    - Select a location for your database and click **"Enable"**.

4.  **Get Your Firebase Configuration:**
    - In the Firebase console, go to your **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Project Overview").
    - In the "General" tab, scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
    - Click the web icon (`</>`) to create a new web app.
    - Give your app a nickname and click **"Register app"**.
    - Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. You will need these values for the next step.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to securely connect to your Firebase project.

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory.

2.  Copy the following content into the `.env.local` file:

    ```bash
    # Firebase Configuration - copy these from your Firebase project settings
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
    ```

3.  Fill in the values for each variable using the `firebaseConfig` object you obtained in the previous step.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies and Run the App

Now you can install the project dependencies and launch the development server.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can open this URL in your browser to see the app in action. You will be able to sign up with a new email and password, and once other users have signed up, you can start chatting with them.
